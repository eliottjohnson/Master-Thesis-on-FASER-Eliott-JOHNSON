The  ForwArd  Search  ExpeRiment  (FASER)  searches  for  light  and  weakly  interacting  particles produced in the decays of light mesons in the far forward region of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. A trigger logic board (TLB) designed and built by the University of Geneva has been commissioned and proved to be suitable for use in the first run of the FASER experiment. Software used for configuring and reading out the TLB has been written and successfully integrated in the FASER digital acquisition system framework.
