ATLAS and CMS, the biggest experiments at the LHC, scrutinize the high transverse momentum
regime of proton-proton collisions to discover new physics. However, if new particles are light
and weakly coupled, this focus may be completely misguided: light particles are typically highly
concentrated within a few mrad of the beam line, out of reach of ATLAS and CMS. ForwArd Search ExpeRiment (FASER) is a small
and inexpensive detector to be installed in the far forward region of proton-proton collisions. It will search for weakly interacting light particles produced in the decays of light mesons - mainly $\pi$ and K - that are abundantly produced in this region. It will collect data during Run 3 and probe new regions of the parameter space for new particles with masses in the \SI{10}{MeV} to GeV range. A Trigger Logic Board (TLB) designed and built by the University of Geneva has been tested and proved to be suitable for use in the first run of the FASER experiment. Software used for configuring and reading out the TLB has been written and successfully integrated in the FASER digital acquisition system framework.
