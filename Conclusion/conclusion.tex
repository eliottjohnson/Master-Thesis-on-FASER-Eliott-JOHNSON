No new physics in high $\text{p}_{T}$ of $pp$ collisions has led the search for light and weakly coupled LLPs and the design and construction of FASER a small and inexpensive detector installed in the far forward region of $pp$ collision. It will collect data during Run 3 and probe new regions of the parameter space for new particles with masses in the 10 MeV to GeV range.

The main result of the present work is the commissioning of the Trigger Logic Board that controls the triggering of the detector, as well as the contribution to the software necessary to the readout and control of the board.

FASER will lead to new physics in area complementary to ATLAS/CMS allowing to fill a gap in the current LHC new physics search.

In the future, a bigger FASER 2 will extend the sensitivity and include new particles produced in heavy meson decays.
