The ForwArd Search ExpeRiment (FASER) searches for light and weakly interacting particles produced in the decays of light mesons in the far forward region of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. This thesis gives information about the data acquisition system (DAQ) and discusses the  commissioning of the Trigger Logic Board's (TLB) hardware. Software used for configuring and reading out the TLB was written and successfully integrated in the FASER DAQ framework.
